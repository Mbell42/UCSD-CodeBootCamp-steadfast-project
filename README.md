# 07_project-01

## Description

This is my third group project for class.  We built an app that allows for users to find sales leads and keep track of them with notes.  This is accomplished by allowing users to sign up or log in, in order to access the ability to store leads and notes. A user does not have to be logged in to use the search function.
